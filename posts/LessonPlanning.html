<h1 id="what-were-gonna-teach-people">What we’re gonna teach people</h1>
<p>There are four main topics that we have decided to try and cover in our lessons, spread over four shorter sessions. This way, students will be able to pick and choose which lessons they want to go to, and we’ll aim to have as little possible cross-over information across the topics, so that nobody will feel out of their depth, or like the lessons have gotten ahead of them.
<br />
<br />
Our four main topics will be cryptocurrency (covering what it is, how it works, what’s been happening with cryptocurrency recently), blockchain (its practical uses, how it works, why it’s so useful), the economy (a full breakdown on how it works), and flutter (our experience developing the app in flutter, a relatively new coding language).
<br />
<br />
Our plan is for our lessons to educate students about cryptocurrencies and the technologies that support them. Both of these topics that have become increasingly prevalent as of late, despite not many people knowing how they actually work. We will be advising students about the dangers of investing in such a volatile sector, and not providing any financial advice per se, rather educating people about what cryptocurrencies are and how they are traded. 
<br />
<br />
Our lessons will include analogies about how cryptocurrencies work to make it simple for anybody interested to understand, talk about some of crypto’s prevalence in the news lately and how it’s impacting our society, give a broader breakdown of how regular investing and the economy work, the benefits of cryptocurrency over traditional currency, and the technological advancements made through blockchain. Hopefully these will give students a proper and balanced insight into the wider topics around cryptocurrency.</p>
