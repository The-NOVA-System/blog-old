<p>(This is being written retroactively as when I sent this message to Garv the fact that we had to write process). This was the day that we started fleshing out the idea further and I came up with the idea that these cryptos could be mined using human work as opposed to the work of a computer. Garv was unsure about the idea at first but as we both looked into the idea further it started looking like a better and better idea. Through this process of delving deeper we found a research paper on the exact topic we were looking at linked <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-53644-5_20">here</a>
We thought that if two university professors had looked into the idea it would at least be promising, and so we continued the journey with this idea. Mushc of the more technical aspects have been discussed ont eh NOVA system blog that can be found <a href="https://the-nova-system.github.io/blog/">here</a></p>

<p>The main problem we have here with this idea however is that the crypto needs to be somehow fueled by the human work puzzles that would be filled in. We don’t know how to make this decentralized so we have to ask some experts on their opinions.</p>
