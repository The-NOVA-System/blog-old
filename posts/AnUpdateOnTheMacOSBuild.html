<h1 id="quick-update">Quick Update</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, i just wanted to make this small blog post in order to have an update on the current MacOS build that is going on. 
Right now Garv is building the softwear on his MacBook Air, honestly i am quiet suprised that it is working as it has 8Gb of ram which is enough for a school but 
usually isnt enough for softwear building, for example Andriod OS usually takes around 52Gb of ram in order to be able to build it. I suggested getting it built on Liam’s
desktop computer which is quiet beefy but that idea was shot down as the dev tools take around 400GB of storage and would take around “40 hours to transfer”(Garv) to Liam’s PC.
Last time i checked with Garv the build was due to be completed in roughly 40 hours which will be great to take for a spin after it has been built as it would probably solve the webapp’s
issue of running into errors when trying to load assets sometimes when the option to buy or to look at your perasonal wallet is changed too quickly. Expect another update on this topic soon,
maybe when it has finished building.</p>
