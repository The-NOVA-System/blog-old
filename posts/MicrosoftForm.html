<p>To understand if the middle school community would actually want in lessons and if they did want lessons what they would want to be taught we were thinking of making a Microsoft forms we can send to everyone in order to get results back in order to start planning out lessons. Here are some pictures of what we have so far. <br /></p>

<p>##Takeaways from the survey
Overall, 93 responses, spread fairly evenly across years 7-9.<br /></p>

<p>72% of the people who answered our survey had some kind of financial literacy but wanted to increase it<br /></p>

<p>44% of people who took our survey had heard about cryptocurrencies on the news or social media recently, which we took as very encouraging – either news articles had peaked their interest, showing that they already liked learning about this sort of thing, or the posts they were being shown on social media were targeted posts from other things that they were already looking at. Many of these people were also expressly interested in learning about them.</p>
