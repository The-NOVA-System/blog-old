# Yay, App Design!
So continuing from the last blog post, I've been working on the app over the holidays. Even though I didn't exactly get 
as much done as I wanted to, I have a UI mockup that I'm pretty proud of so far. The app is based on the wireframe below from [here](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/crypto-app-6a473389-202b-4cee-ad23-94cf46c172cd). <br> <br>
