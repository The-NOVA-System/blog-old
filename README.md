# The NOVA System Blog 
The Main Site: https://the-nova-system.github.io <br><br>
The NOVA System is an alternative cryptocurrency system based on proof of human work verification systems.
This blog serves as a place to record our progress and document the process.

## How to Create Posts:
It's pretty simple, you just create a markdown file with the format YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md in the _posts folder.
Each file must be started with the following structure:
```
---
title:
excerpt:
author:
---
{% include header.html %}
```
<br>
To include images or gifs, just upload the file to the static folder. This is where all of files will be hosted and can be accessed within the markdown. The following line can be used:

```
![Name]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link static/filename %})
```

An example of which would be:

```
![Cat]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link static/cat.gif %})
```

This is done through the use of Jekyll's built-in tag system, which is useful but not exactly flexible. For more control, you can render HTML directly in the markdown file, which works, but is just not ideal. Below is an example of the same cat gif from above, just bigger with HTML:

```
<img alt="Cat" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garv-shah/nova-blog/main/static/cat.gif" width="500"/>
```

### Features of the Blog:
- Inline Maths with $$
- Images and stuff
- Everything should be automatically updated
- etc

## How it Works:
Essentially, the main website is just an RSS Reader, which loads the feed.xml generated by Jekyll (from https://the-nova-system.github.io/blog/feed.xml). This then grabs the headers (title, excerpt and author) and creates a text box with the makeBlogPost() function that gets pushed into the main page. This is all done through the loadFeed.js file :D
