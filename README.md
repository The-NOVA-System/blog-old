# The NOVA System Blog 
The Main Site: https://the-nova-system.github.io <br><br>
The NOVA System is an alternative cryptocurrency system based on proof of human work verification systems.
This blog serves as a place to record our progress and document the process.

## How to Create Posts:
It's pretty simple, you just create a markdown file with the format YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md in the _posts folder.
Each file must be started with the following structure:
```
---
title:
excerpt:
author:
---
{% include header.html %}
```

### Features of the Blog:
- Inline Maths with $$
- Images and stuff
- Everything should be automatically updated
- etc

## How it Works:
Essentially, the main website is just an RSS Reader, which loads the feed.xml generated by Jekyll (from https://the-nova-system.github.io/blog/feed.xml). This then grabs the headers (title, excerpt and author) and creates a text box with the makeBlogPost() function that gets pushed into the main page. This is all done through the loadFeed.js file :D
